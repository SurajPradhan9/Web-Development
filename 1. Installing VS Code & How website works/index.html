<!-- How websites work?  -->
<!-- Websites work through combination of Client Server & Browser. -->

<!-- Client -Me ,Browser- Chrome ,let say we type youtube.com in browser ,from server
browser gives us the result of youtube.com  -->

<!-- (Client sends a request to server through browser,browser is assistant of client
that helps to get the web page from server,server is managed by youtube i.e (we
want youtube.com so youtube)in that server we have some code and server sends
that code ,this code is converted in to web page by browser) -->

<!-- (ideally the response code is 200) -->
<!-- (furthur client interacts with that webpage and browser asks additional requests
to server(i.e if we type code with harry ,generate image etc etc to
server)) -->

<!-- (think it is like an restaurant you give order to waiter, waiter goes in
to the kitchen and sends the order to kitchen(server)and finally when kitchen
gives the order back,the waiter gives the order that you you have asked) -->

<!-- (for some reason if the order is not prepared it gives i.e 404 error ,500 error
,server is not working etc.but ideally 200 response is sent(the order is
prepared)) -->

<!-- what is backend? backend is the server side of the website it stores
and arranges data and also ,makes sure everything on the client side works fine
, it is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with , it is
the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users
(backend can be django flask node.js php ruby etc) -->

<!-- Frontend is combination of HtML CSS and Javascript . -->
<!-- HTML-skeleton ,css- skin(beauty),javascript-brain , -->
<!-- (if we type code with harry in utube it shows some auto results while typing
because the request is sent to server for this query(code with harry)and auto
results are shown ,this all is done using javascript which we called as client
side scripting ,javascript helps page to be dynamic i.e without loading if we
wanna change page is done with javascript) -->

<!-- React Nextjs angular these are frontend frameworks they are used for additional
uses for javascript(eg.to nake it fast etc) -->
