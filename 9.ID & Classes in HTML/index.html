<!-- ID & CLASSES are one of the confusing concepts -->

<!-- ID - an id is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one html
element with in a page.it is often used for unique styling and javascript manipulations. -->

<!-- Class- a class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple html
elements.that way you can easily change their look and behaviour all at
once.classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements.they are
generally used for applying the same styles and behaviour to a group of elements eg:red name class we can give to div as well as form ,likely we can also give bg-red name class we can give to article as well as header tag-->

<!-- ID- eg atharcard our identifier(pehchan) -->
<!-- Name atharcard class
    suraj      9104      class10 classtution10A
vaishnavi     09104      class10
    (from above we can say that unique identifier is atharcard which cannot be same  but class can be same and can have multiple classes(but we dont have multiple ids) we use spaces for allowance of multiple classes i.e class="red(space between red and bg-red)bg-color")red and bg-red are 2 claases -->
